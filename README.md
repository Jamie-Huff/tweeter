# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

Tweeter allows users to make a post up to a maximum of 140 characters.
Tweets are assigned an automatically generated username, and handle to be associated with that specific tweet.

Tweets are displayed on the page in order from most recent -> oldest.

Tweeter's format changes depending on the screen size of the user allowing increased responsivness.
